This project utilizes the Tensorflow framework and Keras library to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) able to recognize handwritten digits recorded in the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset comprises 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples of handwritten digits, 0-9. The goal of this project is to maximize accuracy while minimizing loss and runtime. 

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed and implemented to classify digits by applying filters to formatted 28x28 pixel monochrome images to extract and learn higher-level features. It is composed of a series of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers. The CNN is first trained on the 60000-image training dataset and then tested using the 10000-image testing set for validation. 

In this project, I will experiment with adjusting various parameters and documenting their effects. Following the process dictated, I achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.59%, testing loss of 0.019198, and a final runtime of 252 seconds in the 12th epoch for a total execution time of 3059.848 seconds..
